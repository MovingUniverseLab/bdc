#Notes on reduction.txt


The data reduction steps are copied from KAI and IMAKA.


1) Modfy the scripts to point to the correct directories #expand on this.
	The usual format is to have directories /raw and /reduce, and run the reduction scrips from inside the /reduce directory.
1) Run mk_drk_flt_msk.py, which flips the OSIRIS images, and uses the flat and dark images to generate a mask, dark, and flat.
2) run reduce_pcu_data.py, which uses DAOstarfinder to find stars in the flipped images
